<h1>The Best Movies According to Yuxiang</h1> 
<h2>My Top Three Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Avatar</h3>
<p>This is my favourite sci-fi movie. The CGI was exquisitely done, the script was beautifully written.</p>
<h3>The Last Dance</h3>
<p>This is my recent favourite movie which was made in Hong Kong. The story was about friendship, family relationship and life itself. It was very moving and enlightening at the same time.</p>
<h3>The 300</h3>
<p>The movie portrays the sacrifice everyone in a tightknit team is willing to make for each other. In real life, too many people have only "I"s in their volcabulary.</p>
